At the same time, it is possible to show a visual representation of such temperatures. These images, called thermograms, are obtained by asserting each temperature a different color, thus creating shapes which can be visualized through the display of the equipment or an external monitor.
text.services.thermography.thermography.p2 = Thermographic inspection makes it possible to check from a distance the condition of the links among conductors and even any point which is plausible to raise its temperature due to a bad installation or damage.

The detection of the corona effect is a technique which makes it possible to see each point of an object from a distance, either under a dynamic or stative condition, and at the same time, get a view of its discharges. Corona detection cameras can spot and produce images of light waves generated by the corona. In this way, visibility helps the engineer to apply the suitable means to solve the problem.
text.services.coronaEfect.coronaEfect.p2 = The use of the helicopter to monitor transmission lines allows to detect the insipient corona effect. Proximity together with low flight speed, favors such detection since it is quadratic dependent upon the distance at which it is observed.
